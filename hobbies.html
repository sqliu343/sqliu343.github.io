        The same friend with a surplus of apples also had a surplus of lemons, so we had a day of lemon, complete with lemon meringue pie and severe stomach discomfort...

        A challenge I got from a friend to make a green cake without matcha, pandan, or food coloring. The bottom layer is peas, the middle layer
        is kale/apple and the top layer is lemon/cucumber. We also spent time making cucumber roses. It was surprisingly tasty!
