    <h2>Film</h2>
    <p>
        I became strangely obsessed with film photography (i.e. developing it) after taking a photography class at MIT.
        There were days where I would spend multiple hours in a row testing and developing my photos.<br>

        <img src="images/hobbies-baking/lemonmeringue.png" alt="lemonmeringue" width="500"/><br>
        The same friend with a surplus of apples also had a surplus of lemons, so we had a day of lemon, complete with lemon meringue pie and severe stomach discomfort...
    </p>

        A challenge I got from a friend to make a green cake without matcha, pandan, or food coloring. The bottom layer is peas, the middle layer
        is kale/apple and the top layer is lemon/cucumber (credits to veggiedesserts.com). We also spent time making cucumber roses. It was surprisingly tasty!
