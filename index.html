      Hi! My name is Sandra Liu and I am a robotics researcher. In my PhD at MIT, I worked on
      the design and manufacturing of soft robotic grippers with high-resolution tactile sensing.
      The tactile sensors I developed were inspired by the GelSight sensors created by the Adelson
      Lab. You might know them for their fun-looking rainbow patterns!

      Currently, I am a Roboticist at RAI Institute (formerly known as BDAII), where I work on 
      designing handheld robotic grippers for data collection. 

      I love photography, designwork (i.e. doodling), weightlifting, and green rocks.
