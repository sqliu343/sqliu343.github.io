      Hi! My name is Sandra Liu and I am a robotics researcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my PhD at MIT, I worked on the design and manufacturing of 
      soft robotic grippers with high-resolution tactile sensing.
      The tactile sensors I developed were inspired by the GelSight 
      sensors created by the Adelson Lab. You might know them for 
      their fun-looking rainbow patterns!
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am a Roboticist at RAI Institute (formerly known as BDAII), where I work on 
      designing handheld robotic grippers for data collection. 
    </p>

      I love photography, designwork (i.e. doodling), weightlifting, and green rocks. 
      During the winter season, you might find me skiing; during the rest of the year,
      you might find me doing some combination of climbing, swimming, and very intro 
      level gymnastics.
