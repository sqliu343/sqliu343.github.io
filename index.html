      Hi! My name is Sandra Liu and I am a robotics researcher.
    </p>

    <p>
      I went to Caltech for my undergrad and majored in Mechanical
      Engineering. From there, I joined MIT as a PhD student in 
      Professor Edward (Ted) Adelson's lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my PhD at MIT, I worked on the design and manufacturing of 
      soft robotic grippers with high-resolution tactile sensing.
      The tactile sensors I developed were inspired by the GelSight 
      sensors created by the Adelson Lab. You might know them for 
      their fun-looking rainbow patterns!

      Currently, I am a Roboticist at RAI Institute (formerly known as BDAII), where I work on 
      designing handheld robotic grippers for data collection. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I love photography, designwork (i.e. doodling <img src="images/robot_doodle.png" alt="robotdoodle" 
      height="height: 1em; width:auto vertical-align: middle;">
      ), weightlifting, and green rocks. 
      During the winter season, you might find me skiing; during the rest of the year,
      you might find me doing some combination of climbing, swimming, and very intro 
      level gymnastics.
