        We developed a hand-held, compliant, lasercut acrylic gripper that can 
        firmly pick up raw eggs and is impervious to disturbances such as shaking
        and impacts. The gripper is designed to be used by a human operator
        with average grip strength and also ensures that the acrylic does not
        plastically deform after repeated use. <br>
        This project was done for the MIT Compliant Mechanisms course with 
        fellow students Yuxiang Ma and Stephan Stansfield.

        A passive sit-to-stand assistive device Yuxiang Ma, Stephan Stansfield,
        and I designed and built for the final project of MIT's Compliant 
        Mechanisms course. The device is a cam mechanism that stores energy
        when the user sits down and assists the user as they stand back up.

    <h4>Teaching a Robot How to Throw with RL</h4>

    <p>
        This project, which was done for MIT's Robotic Manipulation class,
        was a joint effort by Megha Tippur and me to teach a robot how to 
        throw a cylinder into a bin. We used different RL policies, 
        reward functions, and action spaces to see how they affected our
        robot's throwing performance. All experiments were done in the
        PyBullet simulator.

    <h4>Strandbeest Simulator</h4>

    <p>
        Inspired by Theo Jansen's Strandbeests and an online simulator 
        showing that the motion of the Strandbeest linkage approximates
        a smooth walking gait, I created a 2D simulator in Python that
        allows users to modify the linkage dimensions and see how they
        affect the walking gait. <br>
        This project was done for the Caltech Intro to Robotics course. <br>

        For the second term of Caltech's Intro to Robotics course, I 
        implemented the Bug 2 algorithm in Python and deployed it in
        the ROS Gazebo Maze simulator. The robot was successfully able
        to navigate to the designated waypoint I gave it.

    <h4>Simple Truss Stability Analyzer GUI</h4>

        In my first year at MIT, I took Gilbert Strang's math class. One of the
        topics we learned was about truss stability calculations. For the final project,
        I decided to create a simple GUI where users can draw a truss structure, complete
        with nodes, supports, and links, and the program will calculate whether the truss
        is stable or not. <br>

    <h4>Strengthening Self-Healing Hydrogels</h4>
    <img src="images/selfhealinghydrogel.png" alt="hydrogel" width="500"/>
    <p>
        As part of MIT's Soft Materials class, I worked with a group of students
        to experiment with strenghtening self-healing hydrogels with clay
        nanoparticles. We found that adding clay nanoparticles to the hydrogel
        decreased the toughness, strength, and elasticity of the hydrogels we
        synthesized, but it helped decrease the relative change in maximum 
        stretchability after self-healing.
