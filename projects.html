        We developed a hand-held, compliant, lasercut acrylic gripper that can 
        firmly pick up raw eggs and is impervious to disturbances such as shaking
        and impacts. The gripper is designed to be used by a human operator
        with average grip strength and also ensures that the acrylic does not
        plastically deform after repeated use. <br>
        This project was done for the MIT Compliant Mechanisms course with 
        fellow students Yuxiang Ma and Stephan Stansfield.

        Inspired by Theo Jansen's Strandbeests and an online simulator 
        showing that the motion of the Strandbeest linkage approximates
        a smooth walking gait, I created a 2D simulator in Python that
        allows users to modify the linkage dimensions and see how they
        affect the walking gait. <br>
        This project done for the Caltech Intro to Robotics course.
